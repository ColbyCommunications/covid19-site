# For both /wp-admin/ and /wp-includes/ :
# Multi domain multisites do not respect the WP_SITEURL constant in Wp-config. Since the vast majority of
# migrated multisites were not set up using this constant, their siteurl location is hard-coded into the db
# Because of this, WordPress and plugins are unaware that core files are located in /wp/. This allows those
# sites to continue to function properly, and single sites are unaffected as they respect the WP_SITEURL
# constant. New multisites set up with the new paradigm will have their siteurl setting set correctly and will
# also not be affected by this setting.
