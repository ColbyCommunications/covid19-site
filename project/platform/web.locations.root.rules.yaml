# We need to allow requests to wp-login.php to pass through
# Multisites do not respect the WP_SITEURL constant in Wp-config. Since the vast majority of
# migrated multisites were not set up using this constant, their siteurl location is hard-coded into the db
# In addition, directory-based multisites include the virtual directory before the wp-login.php
# Because of this, WordPress and plugins are unaware that core files are located in /wp/. This allows those
# sites to continue to function properly, and single sites are unaffected as they respect the WP_SITEURL
# constant. New multisites set up with the new paradigm will have their siteurl setting set correctly and will
# also not be affected by this setting.
