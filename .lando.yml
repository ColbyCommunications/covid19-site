# If you are setting up a WordPress multisite, you will need to uncomment the next few lines.  For each domain in your
# multisite, you will need them in the list. Please append '.lndo.info' to the end of your production domain names
# (e.g. digitalservice.missouri.edu.lndo.info) so the database update script knows how to match your production domain
# names to those in lando.
